THIS VOLUME CONTAINS a collection of pieces that I wrote over the
period 1976 to 1992. They range from autobiographical sketches
through the philosophy of science to attempts to explain the
excitement I feel about science and the universe. The volume
concludes with the transcript of a Desert Island Discs program on
which I appeared. This is a peculiarly British institution in which the
guest is asked to imagine himself or herself cast away on a desert
island and is invited to choose eight records with which to while away
the time until rescued. Fortunately, I didn’t have too long to wait
before returning to civilization.
Because these pieces were written over a period of sixteen years,
they reflect the state of my knowledge at the time, which I hope has
increased over the years. I have therefore given the date and occasion
for which each was composed. As each was meant to be self-
contained, there is inevitably a certain amount of repetition. I have
tried to reduce it, but some remains.
A number of the pieces in this volume were designed to be spoken.
My voice used to be so slurred that I had to give lectures and seminars
through another person, usually one of my research students who
could understand me or who read a text I had written. However, in
1985 I had an operation that removed my powers of speech altogether.
For a time I was without any means of communication. Eventually I
was equipped with a computer system and a remarkably good speech
synthesizer. To my surprise, I found I could be a successful public
speaker, addressing large audiences. I enjoy explaining science and
answering questions. I’m sure I have a lot to learn about how to do it
better, but I hope I’m improving. You can judge for yourselves
whether I am by reading these pages.I do not agree with the view that the universe is a mystery,
something that one can have intuition about but never fully analyze
or comprehend. I feel that this view does not do justice to the
scientific revolution that was started almost four hundred years ago
by Galileo and carried on by Newton. They showed that at least some
areas of the universe do not behave in an arbitrary manner but are
governed by precise mathematical laws. Over the years since then, we
have extended the work of Galileo and Newton to almost every area
of the universe. We now have mathematical laws that govern
everything we normally experience. It is a measure of our success that
we now have to spend billions of dollars to build giant machines to
accelerate particles to such high energy that we don’t yet know what
will happen when they collide. These very high particle energies don’t
occur in normal situations on earth, so it might seem academic and
unnecessary to spend large sums on studying them. But they would
have occurred in the early universe, so we must find out what
happens at these energies if we are to understand how we and the
universe began.
There is still a great deal that we don’t know or understand about
the universe. But the remarkable progress we have made, particularly
in the last hundred years, should encourage us to believe that a
complete understanding may not be beyond our powers. We may not
be forever doomed to grope in the dark. We may break through to a
complete theory of the universe. In that case, we would indeed be
Masters of the Universe.
The scientific articles in this volume were written in the belief that
the universe is governed by an order that we can perceive partially
now and that we may understand fully in the not-too-distant future. It
may be that this hope is just a mirage; there may be no ultimate
theory, and even if there is, we may not find it. But it is surely better
to strive for a complete understanding than to despair of the human
mind.
